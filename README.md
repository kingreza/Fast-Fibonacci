# Fast-Fibonacci
Implementation of Fast Fibonacci algorithms in Swift 3.0

This is a Swift playgound that implements three different Fibonacci algorithms. 
 - Dynamic programming
 - Matrix exponentiation
 - Fast doubling 

For more information on the math and proofs on the algorithms checkout Project Nayuki's article on the Fast [Fibonacci algorithms](https://www.nayuki.io/page/fast-fibonacci-algorithms)
